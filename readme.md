A graph can be represented either as an adcacency matrix
or as an adjacency list.

The file graph_info.txt contains a list of weight of edges from 20
vertices of a graph to each other. That is the first 20 entries are 
weight of edge from vertex 0 to all other 20 vertices including itself. 
Entries with weight 999 denotes that there is no edge between them.

The code reads the file and then adds the edges to an adjacencly list 
representing a graph.
